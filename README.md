# Random-Password-Generator
A simple web-based Random Password Generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate strong, random passwords with a single click. The app uses a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to create secure passwords of a fixed length (16 characters by default).
